TPC-DS BENCHMARKING POSTGRESQL
# Introduction

This repository contains the code files and the corresponding explanation of the first project conducted for the course Data Warehouses, which is part of the Big Data Management and Analytics (BDMA) - Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree Program. It aims to enable other users to replicate our findings and to provide a clearer explanation of the steps involved in conducting a meaningful TPC-DS benchmark for individuals interested in open-source solutions. This project is based on a [previous year's implementation](#acknowledgments) and aims to further improve that solution.

- For a comprehensive explanation of our methodology and results, see the full [report](https://github.com/Carda01/tpcds-benchmark/blob/main/tpc_ds_report.pdf)
 - You can find the final result of our test in our [Power BI dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMmFmNDFmOGMtZjg0MS00NTQwLTk1ZjAtOWFiODNmMDgyNDNhIiwidCI6ImYxMTZkNWYzLTk1NjEtNGIzZi1iNjc4LTQwZTMyNjk4ZTJjMSJ9)
## Prerequisites
To proceed with this project, the user must have Docker and PostgreSQL already downloaded and installed. If these are not yet available, they can be obtained from the following links:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

In addition, you should download the TPC-DS official files from the official website to follow this guide. The link is written below:

- [TPC-DS](https://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/current_specifications5.asp)

Finally, you will need to download this repository.

Thank you!

## Step-by-step guide

### DOWNLOAD AND INSTALLATION
To start this benchmark, download this repository to your computer and unzip the folder. After that, locate the folder named DSGen-software-code-3.2.0rc1 within the TPC-DS official files and move it into the repository folder. Lastly, create a new folder inside the repository and name it "data". Your file structure should look like this:

```
tpcds-benchmark-main
└── all_queries
└── data
└── DSGen-software-code-3.2.0rc1 
└── ...
```

### TPC-DS DATA AND QUERY BUILD:
Let’s begin with preparing the data and queries we will use to perform our benchmark.

#### Step 1: Building the image
Open a terminal into the "tpcds-benchmark-main" folder and build the docker image using the following commands:

 ```sh
  docker build --tag tpcds:ubuntu .
 ```
    
That should take a few seconds.

#### Step 2: Running the compse
Run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
    docker compose up
```
    
This should take a couple of minutes. After your data and queries should have been already built. 

We are ready to jump to the next section. You can check now your data folder. You should find inside many CSV files with the necessary data.

> [!NOTE]  
> If after running the `docker compose up` command you encounter the following error:
>
>  `exec /home/tpcds/tools/auto_run_dsgen.sh: no such file or directory when docker compose`, you should delete the repository, run the following command on git command line:
> ```sh
>    git config --global core.autocrlf false
>```
> And then clone the repository again
    

### CREATING THE DATABASE:
In this section, we will first create the database and bulk-load the data into it. We will use the Jupyter notebook `preprocess_db_setup_load_script.py`.

#### Step 1: Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies by opening a terminal in the "tpcds-benchmark-main" folder and running the following command:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Jupyter Notebook Kernel
Create an IPython kernel in your virtual environment to use it with Jupyter, running the following:
```bash
ipython kernel install --user --name=tpc_ds_kernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=tpc_ds_kernel
python -m bash_kernel.install
```

#### Step 3: Replace the file tpcds_ri.sql 
Use the file `tpcds_ri.sql` from the current repository to replace the file at your `DSGen-software-code-3.2.0rc1>tools>tpcds_ri.sql` to fix potential upcoming constraint creation errors.

#### Step 4: Change and rename the dot_env file as .env file
Rename the file `dot_env` in `.env` and configure it based on your postgres connection

#### Step 5: Start Jupyter Notebook
Start Jupyter notebook by running the following command in the same terminal as step 2:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

#### Step 6: Open Jupyter Notebook
From the file explorer of jupyter notebook, select and open the notebook `preprocess_db_setup_load_script.ipynb`

#### Step 7: Switch kernel of Jupyter Notebook
On the top right of the opened jupyter notebook, switch kernel to `tpc_ds_kernel` (probably previously selected as `Python 3 (ipykernel)`

#### Step 8: Run Jupyter Notebook
In the second cell of the notebook change the port and password of PostgreSQL to the ones that your database uses. Now, run all the cells of the notebook.
